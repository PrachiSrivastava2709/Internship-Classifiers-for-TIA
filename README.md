# Internship-Classifiers-for-TIA
NLP Classifiers using Python

The Classifiers are a part of a bigger project called TIA.
TIA is an AI agent which suggests particular resources/ jupyter notebooks, basically study materials after reviewing an assessment by students.
The Agent had two structures broadly, 
1. Classifier which upon given any question identifies the topic/ category of the question.
2. Reviews score & performance of the student and suggest resources.

In my Internship, I worked on this project and built these NLP Classifiers.

 With  permission from my manager, I am commiting them here for my fellowship application.
